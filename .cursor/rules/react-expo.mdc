When working with React Expo components:

- Use functional components with TypeScript
- Follow structure: imports → interfaces → component → styles → export
- Use React.memo() for performance when needed
- Handle loading and error states
- Use FlatList for large lists
- Implement accessibility labels
- Prefer Expo built-in components

@component-template.tsx
